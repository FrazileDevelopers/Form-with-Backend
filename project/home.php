        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is defined as illness caused by a
        novel coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome
        coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; formerly called 2019-nCoV), which was first
        identified amid an outbreak of respiratory illness cases in Wuhan City,
        Hubei Province, China. It was initially reported to the WHO on December
        31, 2019. On January 30, 2020, the WHO declared the COVID-19 outbreak a
        global health emergency. On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared COVID-19 a
        global pandemic, its first such designation since declaring H1N1
        influenza a pandemic in 2009.

      <h5>To prevent the spread of COVID-19:</h5><br>
      <ul class="ulist">
        <li>
          Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand
          rub.
        </li>
        <li>
          Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
        </li>
        <li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
        <li>Donâ€™t touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
        <li>
          Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue when you
          cough or sneeze.
        </li>
        <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
        <li>
          If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek medical
          attention.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="mass">
      <h5>Masks</h5>
      <p>
        Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person wearing
        the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against COVID-19, and
        should be combined with physical distancing and hand hygiene. Follow the
        advice provided by your local health authority.
